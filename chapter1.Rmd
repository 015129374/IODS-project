# About the project

HOW ARE YOU FEELING RIGHT NOW?  
All of this is new and quite promising, I do not know anything about the subject and learning will be probably challenging. However I am eager to start.  

WHAT DO YOU EXPECT TO LEARN?  
I'd like to learn about processing of quantitative data to be used in my research in political science and organizations. So mainly about working with statistics and also with data visualization.    

WHERE DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THIS COURSE?  
My supervisor has warmly recommended me to enroll in this course.
