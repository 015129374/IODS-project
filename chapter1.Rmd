# About the project

HOW ARE YOU FEELING RIGHT NOW?  
All of this is new and quite promising, I do not know anything about the subject and learning will be probably challenging. However I am eager to start. I have experienced some difficulties in this first task as I am unfamiliar with the whole thing. In the end, I succeeded to overcome those problems.  

WHAT DO YOU EXPECT TO LEARN?  
I'd like to learn about processing of large datasets to be used in my research. My specialization is in political science and organizations. So, I would like to learn mainly about working with statistics and also with data visualization.    

WHERE DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THIS COURSE?  
My supervisor has warmly recommended me to enrol in this course.
