# About the project

#### How are your feeling right now?  
All of this is new and quite promising, I do not know anything about the subject and learning will be probably challenging. However I am eager to start. I have experienced some difficulties in this first task as I am unfamiliar with the whole thing. In the end, I succeeded to overcome those problems.  

#### What do you expect to learn?  
I'd like to learn about processing of large datasets to be used in my research. My specialization is in political science and organizations. So, I would like to learn mainly about working with statistics and also with data visualization.    

#### Where did you hear about this course?  
My supervisor has warmly recommended me to enrol in this course.
